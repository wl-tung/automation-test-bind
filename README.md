## 🛠️ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues**

#### **WebKit Popup Issues**

```bash
# Use the proven WebKit solution
# Framework automatically handles with window.open approach
```

#### **Upload Button Not Found**

```bash
# Framework uses multiple selector strategies
# Check test-data/images/ directory exists with testimage.jpg
```

#### **Timeout Issues**

```bash
# Increase timeout for complex operations
npx playwright test --timeout=300000
```

### **Debug Mode**

```bash
# Run with debug information
npx playwright test --debug

# Generate trace for analysis
npx playwright test --trace=on
=======
# 1. Navigate to test directory
cd playwright-tests

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install

# 4. Verify setup
npm test
```

## 🎯 Running Tests

### **Basic Commands**

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:headed

# Run specific test case
npx playwright test tests/e2e/Site-Creation-Test.spec.ts -g "SCT-01"

# Cross-browser testing
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=webkit
npx playwright test --project=firefox

npx playwright test tests/e2e/Site-Performance-Test.spec.ts -g "SPF-01"
```

### **Advanced Testing Options**

```bash
# Debug mode with browser dev tools
npx playwright test --debug

# Generate test report
npx playwright show-report

# Run tests with video recording
npx playwright test --video=on

# Run tests with trace
npx playwright test --trace=on

# Timeout configuration
npx playwright test --timeout=300000  # 5 minutes

# Sequential execution (recommended for stability)
npx playwright test --workers=1
```

## 🧹 Site Cleanup & Maintenance

### **Automatic Cleanup**

All tests automatically clean up created sites using the robust cleanup system:

- **Multiple Detection Strategies** - Various selectors to find sites reliably
- **Aggressive Deletion Approaches** - Right-click, direct button, hover methods
- **Smart Confirmation Handling** - Automatic dialog detection
- **Deletion Verification** - Confirms sites are actually removed
- **Non-blocking Error Handling** - Cleanup failures don't break tests

### **Manual Cleanup (Server Maintenance)**

```bash
# Navigate to utils directory
cd playwright-tests/utils

# Dry run to see what would be deleted
node global-cleanup.js --dry-run

# Actual cleanup of test sites
node global-cleanup.js
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Environment Setup**

1. **Test Data Setup**: Update `data/test-data.ts` with your credentials
2. **Browser Configuration**: Modify `playwright.config.ts` for your needs
3. **Timeout Settings**: Adjust timeouts based on your environment performance

### **Main Configuration (`playwright.config.ts`)**

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  timeout: 300000, // 5 minutes per test
  expect: { timeout: 30000 }, // 30 seconds for assertions
  retries: 2, // Retry failed tests twice
  workers: 1, // Sequential execution for stability

  projects: [
    { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
    { name: 'webkit', use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] } },
    { name: 'firefox', use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] } },
  ],

  use: {
    headless: false, // Set to true for CI/CD
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure',
    trace: 'retain-on-failure',
  },
});
```

## 🛡️ Best Practices

### **Test Development**

1. **Use Page Object Model** - Organize page interactions in fixtures
2. **Implement Smart Waits** - Use network idle and element visibility
3. **Add Comprehensive Logging** - Use TestLogger for detailed output
4. **Handle Cross-browser Differences** - Browser-specific optimizations
5. **Implement Cleanup** - Always clean up test data

### **Performance Optimization**

1. **Sequential Execution** - Use `--workers=1` for stability
2. **Appropriate Timeouts** - Balance speed vs reliability
3. **Smart Element Detection** - Multiple fallback strategies
4. **Resource Management** - Proper browser and page cleanup

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **WebKit Crashes** - Known browser stability issue, not framework related
2. **Element Not Found** - Check element selectors and wait strategies
3. **Timeout Errors** - Increase timeouts or improve wait conditions
4. **Cleanup Failures** - Use global cleanup utility for manual cleanup

### **Debug Commands**

```bash
# Debug specific test
npx playwright test --debug tests/e2e/Site-Creation-Test.spec.ts

# Generate trace for analysis
npx playwright test --trace=on

# Run with verbose logging
DEBUG=pw:api npx playwright test
